## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Before Going Live

### 1. Environment Configuration (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Backend (.env) - MUST CHANGE:**
```bash
# Generate strong secrets
openssl rand -base64 32  # For JWT_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32  # For SESSION_SECRET

# Update .env file
JWT_SECRET=<generated-secret-here>
SESSION_SECRET=<generated-secret-here>
NODE_ENV=production
DB_PASSWORD=<strong-database-password>
CORS_ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com
