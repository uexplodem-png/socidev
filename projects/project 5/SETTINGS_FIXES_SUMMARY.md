# Settings & System Configuration Fixes - Complete Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to the settings system, financial controls, and email notifications.

---

## 1. Site Name Not Updating ✅

### Problem
Site name could be changed in the admin panel but wasn't properly synced across the system.

### Solution
- Updated backend settings route to sync individual setting keys when general settings are saved
- Added `site.name` key that's stored separately for easy access
- Settings now properly save to database with both `general` object and individual keys

**Backend Changes:**
- `backend_combined/src/routes/admin/settings.js`: Added syncing of `site.name` setting

**Frontend Changes:**
- `admin-panel/src/components/settings/GeneralTab.tsx`: Updated to use `realApiService.updateSettings()` for direct object updates

---

## 2. Maintenance Mode Not Enforced ✅

### Problem
Maintenance mode was active but users could still login, create orders, and perform all actions.

### Solution
- Enhanced `maintenanceMode` middleware to properly block non-admin requests
- Allows health checks and admin routes to pass through
- Allows login endpoint so admins can still access the system
- Blocks all other requests for non-admin users with 503 status code

**Key Code:**
```javascript
// Allow admin routes and health check
if (req.path === '/health' || req.path.startsWith('/api/admin/')) {
  return next();
}

// Allow login for admins
if (req.path === '/api/auth/login' || req.path === '/api/auth/verify') {
  return next();
}

// Check if user is admin or has settings.edit permission
if (req.user && (req.user.role === 'super_admin' || req.user.role === 'admin')) {
  return next();
}

// Block everyone else with 503
return res.status(503).json({
  error: 'Service temporarily unavailable for maintenance',
  code: 'MAINTENANCE_MODE',
  maintenance: true
});
```

**Files Modified:**
- `backend_combined/src/middleware/security.js`: Enhanced maintenance mode middleware

---

## 3. Registration Not Blocked When Disabled ✅

### Problem
Users could register even when registration was disabled in settings.

### Solution
- Added validation in registration controller to check `registration.enabled` setting
- Returns 403 error when registration is disabled
- Setting is synced when admin changes it

**Key Code:**
```javascript
// Check if registration is enabled
const registrationEnabled = await settingsService.get('registration.enabled', true);
if (!registrationEnabled) {
  throw new ApiError(403, 'Registration is currently disabled. Please contact support.');
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `backend_combined/src/controllers/auth.controller.js`: Added registration check
- `backend_combined/src/routes/admin/settings.js`: Syncs `registration.enabled` setting

---

## 4. Max Tasks Per User Not Enforced ✅

### Problem
The `maxTasksPerUser` setting existed but wasn't being enforced during task claiming.

### Solution
- Added check in `startTask` method to count user's pending tasks
- Compares against `tasks.maxPerUser` setting (default: 10)
- Rejects task claim if user has reached limit

**Key Code:**
```javascript
// Check max tasks per user limit from settings
const maxTasksPerUser = await settingsService.get('tasks.maxPerUser', 10);
const userPendingTasksCount = await TaskExecution.count({
  where: {
    userId,
    status: "pending",
  }
});

if (userPendingTasksCount >= maxTasksPerUser) {
  throw new ApiError(
    400,
    `You have reached the maximum limit of ${maxTasksPerUser} concurrent tasks.`
  );
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `backend_combined/src/services/task.service.js`: Added max tasks validation
- `backend_combined/src/routes/admin/settings.js`: Syncs `tasks.maxPerUser` setting

---

## 5. Withdrawal Validations Not Applied ✅

### Problem
- Minimum withdrawal amount wasn't enforced
- Withdrawal fee percentage wasn't calculated or deducted

### Solution
- Updated `validateWithdrawalRequest` to use settings for min amount
- Calculates fee based on `withdrawal.feePercent` setting
- Returns both fee and total amount that will be deducted
- Updated Withdrawal model to store `fee` and `totalAmount` fields

**Key Code:**
```javascript
async validateWithdrawalRequest(userId, amount) {
  // Get minimum withdrawal amount from settings
  const minWithdrawalAmount = await settingsService.get('withdrawal.minAmount', 10);
  if (amount < minWithdrawalAmount) {
    throw new ApiError(400, `Minimum withdrawal amount is ₺${minWithdrawalAmount}`);
  }

  // Get withdrawal fee percentage from settings
  const withdrawalFeePercent = await settingsService.get('withdrawal.feePercent', 0);
  const fee = (amount * withdrawalFeePercent) / 100;
  const totalAmount = amount + fee;

  if (user.balance < totalAmount) {
    throw new ApiError(
      400, 
      `Insufficient balance. Required: ₺${totalAmount.toFixed(2)}`
    );
  }

  return { fee, totalAmount };
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `backend_combined/src/services/withdrawal.service.js`: Added validation and fee calculation
- `backend_combined/src/models/Withdrawal.js`: Added `fee` and `totalAmount` fields
- `backend_combined/src/routes/admin/settings.js`: Syncs withdrawal settings

---

## 6. Balance/Transaction Fee Setting Added ✅

### Problem
No setting for platform transaction fees.

### Solution
- Added `balanceFee` field to general settings interface
- Added input field in admin panel
- Setting is saved and synced as `balance.feePercent`
- Can be applied to various transaction types in the future

**Frontend Changes:**
- `admin-panel/src/components/settings/GeneralTab.tsx`: Added balance fee input field

**Backend Changes:**
- `backend_combined/src/routes/admin/settings.js`: Syncs `balance.feePercent` setting

---

## 7. Currency Display Fixed ✅

### Problem
Task detail page showed `$10.000` instead of `₺10.00`.

### Solution
- Changed currency symbol from `$` to `₺` (Turkish Lira)
- Changed decimal places from `.toFixed(3)` to `.toFixed(2)`

**Files Modified:**
- `admin-panel/src/pages/TaskDetail.tsx`: Updated rate display

---

## 8. Dynamic Email Notification System ✅

### Problem
No email system for user notifications (welcome, orders, withdrawals, etc.).

### Solution
- Created comprehensive EmailService with template support
- Installed `nodemailer` and `handlebars` for dynamic templating
- Created professional HTML email templates
- Integrated with registration and withdrawal flows
- Respects `email.notifications.enabled` setting

### Features
- **Template System**: Uses Handlebars for dynamic content
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly HTML emails
- **Brand Consistency**: Uses gradient colors matching the platform

- **Error Handling**: Logs errors but doesn't break main flow
- **Async Sending**: Emails sent asynchronously to not block responses

### Email Types Implemented
1. **Welcome Email** - Sent when user registers
2. **Order Status Update** - Sent when order status changes
3. **Withdrawal Request** - Sent when withdrawal is requested
4. **Withdrawal Completed** - Sent when withdrawal is processed
5. **Task Completion** - Can be sent when task is completed
6. **Generic Notification** - For custom messages
