# Copilot Instructions for this Project

## Important Guidelines
- **DO NOT create summary files** (no SUMMARY.md, COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md, etc.)
- **DO NOT create documentation files** for tracking progress
- Focus only on actual code changes and fixes
- Keep all explanations in the chat, not in files
- Work directly with the existing codebase without adding new meta-files

## Project Context
- This is a full-stack social media management platform
- Stack: React (frontend/admin-panel), Node.js/Express (backend), MySQL (database)
- Three running apps: Backend (3000), Admin Panel (5173), Frontend (5174)

## When working on tasks:
1. Make direct code changes only
2. Test changes and verify they work
3. Report results in chat (not in files)
4. Suggest next steps conversationally

## GitHub Backup Protocol
**IMPORTANT: Back up every action to GitHub!**
After every significant change or task completion:
1. Stage changes: `git add .`
2. Commit with clear message: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
3. Push to GitHub: `git push`

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/uexplodem-png/socidev
- Keep commits small and meaningful
- Use present tense in commit messages (e.g., "Add user validation" not "Added")
- Push frequently to maintain backup
