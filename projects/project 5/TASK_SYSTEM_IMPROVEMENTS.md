# Task System Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the task management system to prevent task owners from claiming their own tasks, implement a task reservation system, and automatically release uncompleted tasks.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend Service Layer (`backend_combined/src/services/task.service.js`)

#### A. Enhanced Task Filtering in `getAvailableTasks()`
- **Objective**: Prevent task owners from seeing or claiming their own tasks
- **Changes**:
  - Modified WHERE clause to explicitly exclude tasks where `userId` matches the current user
  - Added order `userId` filtering to prevent users from claiming tasks from their own orders
  - Updated Order association to include `userId` field for ownership validation
  - Added filter in the `.filter()` method to check `taskData.order.userId === userId`

**Key Code**:
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Always exclude tasks created by the current user
where[Op.or] = [
  { 
    userId: null, // Order-based tasks
    orderId: { [Op.ne]: null }
  },
  { 
    userId: { [Op.ne]: userId } // Other users' direct tasks
  }
];

// Filter out tasks from user's own orders
if (taskData.order && taskData.order.userId === userId) {
  return false;
}
```

#### B. Task Reservation System in `startTask()`
- **Objective**: Reserve task slots when claimed and set 1-hour completion deadline
- **Changes**:
  1. Added order owner validation to prevent claiming own order's tasks
  2. Check for existing pending executions to prevent duplicate claims
  3. Decrement `task.remainingQuantity` by 1 when task is claimed
  4. Set `cooldownEndsAt` to 1 hour from claim time on TaskExecution
  5. Set `startedAt` on TaskExecution for tracking
  6. Added audit logging with cooldown information

**Key Code**:
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Prevent users from claiming their own order's tasks
if (task.order && task.order.userId === userId) {
  throw new ApiError(400, "You cannot claim tasks from your own orders");
}

// RESERVATION SYSTEM: Decrease remaining quantity when task is claimed
await task.decrement('remainingQuantity', {
  by: 1,
  transaction: dbTransaction,
});

// Set 1-hour timeout for task completion
const now = new Date();
const cooldownEndsAt = addHours(now, 1);

const execution = await TaskExecution.create({
  userId,
  taskId,
  status: "pending",
  executedAt: now,
  startedAt: now,
  cooldownEndsAt: cooldownEndsAt, // 1-hour window to complete
}, { transaction: dbTransaction });
```

### 2. Auto-Release Scheduler (`backend_combined/src/services/task.scheduler.js`)

**New File Created**

- **Objective**: Automatically release tasks not completed within 1 hour
- **Features**:
  - Runs every 5 minutes using `node-schedule`
  - Finds TaskExecutions with `status='pending'` and `cooldownEndsAt < now`
  - Restores `task.remainingQuantity` by incrementing it
  - Marks execution as `'failed'` status
  - Comprehensive logging of released tasks
  - Graceful error handling per execution

**Key Code**:
```javascript
// Find all pending task executions that have expired
const expiredExecutions = await TaskExecution.findAll({
  where: {
    status: 'pending',
    cooldownEndsAt: {
      [Op.lt]: now,
    },
    completedAt: null,
  },
  // ... includes
});

// Restore the task's remaining quantity
await Task.increment('remainingQuantity', {
  by: 1,
  where: { id: execution.taskId },
  transaction,
});

// Mark the execution as failed
await execution.update({
  status: 'failed',
  completedAt: now,
}, { transaction });
```

**Integration**: Scheduler started in `server.js`:
```javascript
import { taskScheduler } from './services/task.scheduler.js';

// In startServer()
taskScheduler.start();

// In gracefulShutdown()
taskScheduler.stop();
```

### 3. Admin API Endpoint (`backend_combined/src/routes/admin/tasks.js`)

**New Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/tasks/uncompleted`

- **Objective**: Provide admin visibility into tasks claimed but not completed
- **Features**:
  - Returns TaskExecutions with `status='failed'` OR `status='pending'` with expired cooldown
  - Includes user, task, and timing information
  - Calculates `overdueMinutes` for each execution
  - Flags whether task was auto-released by scheduler
  - Supports pagination

**Response Format**:
```javascript
{
  executions: [
    {
      id: "uuid",
      userId: "uuid",
      User: { username, email, ... },
      task: { title, type, platform, ... },
      startedAt: "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
      cooldownEndsAt: "2025-01-15T11:00:00Z",
      overdueMinutes: 45,
      wasAutoReleased: true
    }
  ],
  pagination: { page, limit, total, totalPages }
}
```

### 4. Frontend API Service (`admin-panel/src/services/`)

#### A. Real API Service (`realApi.ts`)
**New Method**: `getUncompletedTasks(params)`
```typescript
async getUncompletedTasks(params: FilterParams = {}): Promise<PaginatedResponse<any>> {
  const queryParams = new URLSearchParams();
  Object.entries(params).forEach(([key, value]) => {
    if (value !== undefined && value !== null) {
      queryParams.append(key, String(value));
    }
  });
  return this.request<any>(`/admin/tasks/uncompleted?${queryParams}`);
}
```

#### B. API Service (`api.ts`)
**Exported Method**:
```typescript
getUncompletedTasks: async (params: FilterParams = {}) => {
  return realApiService.getUncompletedTasks(params);
}
```

### 5. Admin Panel UI (`admin-panel/src/pages/Tasks.tsx`)

**New "Uncompleted" Tab**

- **Changes**:
  - Updated `activeTab` type to include `'uncompleted'`
  - Added new tab button in navigation
  - Modified `fetchTasks()` to handle uncompleted data
  - Maps TaskExecutions to task-like format for table display

**Key Code**:
```typescript
if (activeTab === 'uncompleted') {
  const uncompletedData: any = await tasksAPI.getUncompletedTasks(params);
  const mappedTasks = (uncompletedData.executions || []).map((exec: any) => ({
    id: exec.id,
    userId: exec.userId,
    userName: exec.User?.username || ...,
    userEmail: exec.User?.email,
    type: exec.task?.type,
    platform: exec.task?.platform,
    targetUrl: exec.task?.targetUrl,
    status: exec.wasAutoReleased ? 'auto-released' : 'overdue',
    taskTitle: exec.task?.title,
    startedAt: exec.startedAt,
    cooldownEndsAt: exec.cooldownEndsAt,
    overdueMinutes: exec.overdueMinutes,
    description: `Claimed but not completed. Overdue by ${exec.overdueMinutes} minutes`,
  }));
  setTasks(mappedTasks);
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Prevents Self-Dealing**
- Task owners cannot see their own tasks in available lists
- Order creators cannot claim tasks from their own orders
- Comprehensive validation at multiple layers (service, controller)

### 2. **Fair Task Distribution**
- Reservation system prevents race conditions
- `remainingQuantity` decreases immediately when task is claimed
- Other users see accurate availability counts

### 3. **Automatic Resource Recovery**
- Tasks not completed within 1 hour are automatically released
- Restores task slots for other users to claim
- Prevents indefinite "stuck" states

### 4. **Admin Visibility**
- Uncompleted tab shows problematic task claims
- Identifies users who frequently abandon tasks
- Provides data for improving task completion rates

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Task Ownership Restrictions**
- [ ] User cannot see their own direct tasks in available list
- [ ] User cannot see tasks from their own orders
- [ ] Attempting to start own task returns error

✅ **Task Reservation**
- [ ] `remainingQuantity` decreases by 1 when task is claimed
- [ ] Cannot claim task twice (duplicate prevention)
- [ ] `cooldownEndsAt` is set to 1 hour from claim time
- [ ] Task appears with correct remaining quantity to other users

✅ **Auto-Release System**
- [ ] Scheduler starts on server startup
- [ ] Tasks uncompleted after 1 hour are marked as 'failed'
- [ ] `remainingQuantity` is restored when task is released
- [ ] Logs show released task information

✅ **Uncompleted Tasks Tab**
- [ ] Tab displays tasks with expired cooldowns
- [ ] Shows correct user and task information
- [ ] Displays overdue duration in minutes
- [ ] Differentiates auto-released vs still-pending tasks

## Database Schema Requirements

### Task Model
- `remainingQuantity`: INTEGER - Must exist and be properly decremented
- `orderId`: UUID - Must exist for order association

### TaskExecution Model
- `startedAt`: DATE - Set when task is claimed
- `cooldownEndsAt`: DATE - Set to 1 hour from start
- `status`: ENUM - Must include 'pending', 'completed', 'failed'
- `completedAt`: DATE - NULL for uncompleted tasks

## Configuration

### Scheduler Timing
Default: Runs every 5 minutes
```javascript
// Change schedule in task.scheduler.js
this.job = schedule.scheduleJob('*/5 * * * *', async () => { ... });

// For testing (every minute):
this.job = schedule.scheduleJob('* * * * *', async () => { ... });
```

### Timeout Duration
Default: 1 hour for task completion
```javascript
// Change in task.service.js startTask()
const cooldownEndsAt = addHours(now, 1); // Change 1 to desired hours
```

## Migration Considerations

If database doesn't have required fields:
1. Add `cooldownEndsAt` to TaskExecution model
2. Ensure `remainingQuantity` exists on Task model
3. Add `orderId` to Task model if using order-based tasks
4. Update existing TaskExecutions to have initial `cooldownEndsAt` values

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logs to Monitor
- Scheduler job execution: `"Running task auto-release job..."`
- Released tasks: `"Released task execution {id}"`
- Errors: `"Error in task auto-release job"`

### Metrics to Track
- Number of tasks auto-released per day
- Average overdue duration
- Users with high abandonment rates
- Tasks frequently abandoned (may indicate issue)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable Timeout**: Allow different timeout durations per task type
2. **Warning System**: Notify users 10 minutes before timeout
3. **Penalty System**: Track user abandonment rate, apply cooldowns
4. **Priority Queue**: Give tasks released multiple times higher priority
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize completion rates and abandonment patterns

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Stop scheduler: Comment out `taskScheduler.start()` in server.js
2. Remove owner filtering: Revert changes to `getAvailableTasks()`
3. Disable reservation: Comment out `task.decrement()` in `startTask()`
4. Remove uncompleted tab: Delete from Tasks.tsx

## Conclusion

All 6 tasks have been successfully implemented:
1. ✅ Task owner exclusion from available lists
2. ✅ Task reservation with quantity decrement
3. ✅ Auto-release scheduler (every 5 minutes)
4. ✅ Uncompleted tasks API endpoint
5. ✅ Frontend "Uncompleted" tab
6. ✅ Ready for testing

The system now provides fair task distribution, prevents self-dealing, automatically recovers stalled resources, and gives admins visibility into task completion behavior.
